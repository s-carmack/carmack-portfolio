Welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me
Hi everyone! My name is Shun-Sho Carmack (she/her/hers) and I am a second year candidate for the Master of Arts Management program in Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. My background education is a BFA in Studio Arts, a BA in Journalism & Communications, and a MS in Library and Information Science. 

Currently, I am a program manager for Arts Greenhouse, an arts & humanitites initiative that provides programming to underserved and underresourced 5th-9th grade students in the Pittsburgh region.

My research interests lie at the intersection of access, intangible cultural heritage, education, community wellness, and ethics.

# I hope to learn
Despite my background, my data visualization skills are woefully poor and I've spent very little time learning how to present raw data attractively. I find the process so stressful that I avoid making any visualizations altogether. Through this course, I'm hoping that will change. I would like to build a basic foundation for where to start with making graphs, using  insights into how people generally interpret graphs and charts to then take complex data and showcase the most complicated parts in simplified ways. Beyond that, my hope is that the process of data visualization will become less terrifying and more fun as I move towards using it to support my projects.

This course will be particularly helpful for my post-graduation plans as an assistant director dealing with community engagement and educational outreach. When the announcement becomes public, I look forward to sharing the official title and organization with you all.
