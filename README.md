# About me
Hi everyone! My name is Shun-Sho Carmack (she/her/hers) and I am a second year candidate for the Master of Arts Management program at Carnegie Mellon Univeresity. I also have a BFA in Studio Arts, a BA in Journalism & Communications, and a MS in Library and Information Science. 

Currently, I am a Program Manager for Arts Greenhouse, a small arts & humanitites initiative that provides programming to underserved and underresourced 5th-9th grade students in the Pittsburgh region.

My research interests lie at the intersection of access, intangible cultural heritage, and education.

# I hope to learn
Despite my background, my data visualization skills are woefully poor and I've spent very little time learning about how to present raw data attractively. I find the process so stressful that I avoid making any pieces altogether. Through this course, I'm hoping that will change. I would like to build a basic foundation for where to start with making graphs, using  insights into how people generally interpret graphs and charts to then take complex data and showcase the most complicated parts in simplified ways. Beyond that, my hope is that the process of data visualization will become less terrifying and more fun as I move towards using it to support my projects.

I have received a job offer to become an assistant director of community engagement and educational outreach. After it becomes official, I look forward to sharing the organization and location.
