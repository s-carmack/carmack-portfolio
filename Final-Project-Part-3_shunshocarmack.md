### Final Project, Part 3

This is the final installment for the ongoing process for creating my final project.

For Part 1, refer to this page:

For Part 2, refer to this page:

Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. 
Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. Include all references for materials used

Following the feedback on Part 2, I took a step back from the project and considered how I might broaden the story. Although my audience thought the concept was valid, the story was short and limited in breadth. Additionally, after I reviewed the initial story arc, I found that the story was decentralized from the idea of disabilities and focused more on diversity in general, which wasn't what I wanted to focus on. Given the little data available on disabilties in children's literature, I decided to see if there was any data existing in childdren's media at large. I was able to locate a recent study done in the same time frame that discussed the level of disabilities in children's television and film. With this, I moved forward with the process. 

Before discussing the process of building the story, I made a few decisions regarding technology and color schemes. I decided to do the project still in Shorthand. Although I could have revised the original wire frame from Part 2, I decided that there were too many issues with its structure and arrangement to make it worthwhile. As such, I started over with a brand new layout. Although most of the mechanisms were unchanged given Shorthand's available templates, it allowed me to approach the new story without the bias of the previous layout. Interestingly, after broadening my story, I was able to consider more ways of visualizing data while also standardizing some visualizations. With that, I also found that the aspects I had struggled with in Flourish during previous projects were much easier for me to navigate. So, all of my visualizations came from Flourish. All of my images were obtained through Unsplash. Tangentally, I thought it was very interesting to see that the number of free images about people with disabilities was limited. Finding images of children with images was even harder to come by. Finally, I wanted to select a color scheme that was representative of disabilities in general. With such a wide range of disabilities, it was impossible to find a color scheme that represented them all without turing the visualizations into a rainbow mess. I found that the most common color used by disability causes was blue. I used that as the primary color for my visualizations that dealt with disability. To ensure a sharp contrast, I selected an orange-yellow. I purposefully avoided using gray, red, or black, because I didn't want there to be any negative connotations or associations with being non-disable and I didn't want it to seem unimportant for the comparison of non-disabled people with disabled representation.

With the new layout, I chose to create a basic structure that accounted for the different categories of Children's Media but I then focused specifically on the U.S. Population data on disabilities. This was difficult task because although many agencies and organizations are gathering or recording different aspects of disabilities in the U.S., the data is scattered and not always aligned with each other. This meant that each data point needed to be fact-checked with other agencies to see what is most prevalent in the existing data. Once I confirmed the most commonly-held estimates, I was able to construct an argument about how children encounter disabilities in their daily lifes. Based on the data I was able to collate, I elected to use four different visualization techniques: column chart, a doughnut chart, area map, and unit chart. These allowed me to emphasize different aspects of the data, including state population data, parts of a total number, and comparison between years.

After completing this section, I turned my attention to the data regarding the different children's media categories. I decided to use a unit chart with a humanoid figure for each section to show how many individuals represented disabilities in each medium. I specifically did not use a wheelchair icon or any icon that showed disabled individuals. I did so for two reasons. First, one problem with disabilities representation is that the focus is often on the disability and not the person who has the disability. This is a toxic narrative and I did not want to contribute to that narrative. Secondly, incorporating disabled icons with abled icons made the visualizations messy and less appealing. Between the practical and philosophical reasons, I elected to use a humanoid figure that only showed the upper half of the body.
