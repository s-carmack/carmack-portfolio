### Part 3
Following the feedback on [Part 2](https://s-carmack.github.io/carmack-portfolio/Final-Project-Part-2_shunshocarmack.html), I took a step back from the project and considered how I might broaden the story. Although my audience thought the concept was valid, the story was short and limited in breadth. Additionally, after I reviewed the initial story arc, I found that the story was decentralized from the idea of disabilities and focused more on diversity in general, which wasn't what I wanted to focus on. Given the little data available on disabilties in children's literature, I decided to see if there was any data existing in childdren's media at large. I was able to locate a recent study done in the same time frame that discussed the level of disabilities in children's television and film. Following this, I retitled the story and reoutlined the general flow of the story to ensure that I focused on the main topic throughout.

#### Audience
Although I broadened my media coverage, I determined that my **audience** for this story was essentially the same as the original premise, with the addition of industry sector representatives. The ultimate audiences were:
1. Caretakers
2. Librarians and Store Owners
3. Writers, Publishers, and Producers

I kept these people in mind during the story design and it contributed to how I highlighted facts next to graphs, drawing out some of the data and synthesizing it with words for people who are short on time (e.g. caretakers) to have quick facts to digest or carry away with them. I also made sure that it was compared to national population data because I wanted to show people who are responsible for providing access to media that is representative (librarians, store owners, wirters, publishers, producers) that there's a huge market that isn't being tapped. Finally, I wanted to make sure that I addressed the fact that while the leap to representing children identified with disabilities seems really close, the number doesn't begin to account for the experiences that children have with adults who have disabilities overall. This was added to ensure that even if any of the audiences didn't think there were enough children to warrant an increase in child representation, the importance of children seeing disabilities represented in their media overall was still a necessity. One final aspect I employed due to the audience was a sense of back-and-forth conversation. This was an attempt to answer questions that readers might have during the presentation, particularly people who aren't always comfortable with connecting data points (caretakers, librarians, writers).

#### Methods and Mediums
Before discussing the process of building the story, I made a few decisions regarding technology and color schemes. I decided to do the project still in Shorthand. Although I could have revised the original wire frame from Part 2, I decided that there were too many issues with its structure and arrangement to make it worthwhile. As such, I started over with a brand new layout. Although most of the mechanisms were unchanged given Shorthand's available templates, it allowed me to approach the new story without the bias of the previous layout. Interestingly, after broadening my story, I was able to consider more ways of visualizing data while also standardizing some visualizations. With that, I also found that the aspects I had struggled with in Flourish during previous projects were much easier for me to navigate. So, all of my visualizations came from Flourish. All of my images were obtained through Unsplash. Tangentally, I thought it was very interesting to see that the number of free images about people with disabilities was limited. Finding images of children with images was even harder to come by. Finally, I wanted to select a color scheme that was representative of disabilities in general. With such a wide range of disabilities, it was impossible to find a color scheme that represented them all without turing the visualizations into a rainbow mess. I found that the most common color used by disability causes was blue. I used that as the primary color for my visualizations that dealt with disability and chose four different blues for children and a blue for adults. To ensure a sharp contrast, I selected an orange-yellow for non-disabled represntation. I purposefully avoided using gray, red, or black, because I didn't want there to be any negative connotations or associations with being non-disable and I didn't want it to seem unimportant for the comparison of non-disabled people with disabled representation.

#### Build Process
With the new layout, I chose to create a basic structure that accounted for the different categories of Children's Media but I then focused specifically on the U.S. Population data on disabilities. This was difficult task because although many agencies and organizations are gathering or recording different aspects of disabilities in the U.S., the data is scattered and not always aligned with each other. This meant that each data point needed to be fact-checked with other agencies to see what is most prevalent in the existing data. Once I confirmed the most commonly-held estimates, I was able to construct an argument about how children encounter disabilities in their daily lifes. Based on the data I was able to collate, I elected to use four different visualization techniques: column chart, a doughnut chart, area map, and unit chart. These allowed me to emphasize different aspects of the data, including state population data, parts of a total number, and comparison between years.

After completing this section, I turned my attention to the data regarding the different children's media categories. I decided to use a unit chart with a humanoid figure for each section to show how many individuals represented disabilities in each medium. I specifically did not use a wheelchair icon or any icon that showed disabled individuals. I did so for two reasons. First, one problem with disabilities representation is that the focus is often on the disability and not the person who has the disability. This is a toxic narrative and I did not want to contribute to that narrative. Secondly, incorporating disabled icons with abled icons made the visualizations messy and less appealing. Between the practical and philosophical reasons, I elected to use a humanoid figure that only showed the upper half of the body.

Finally, I created three different sets of recommendations or action plans for the three audience segments. I purposefully kept the list for each audience segment to three steps, both for consistency but also to not overwhelm any audience segment. After this, I went through the entire story multiple times to try and gauge its flow. I was also able to get feedback from one of the previous interview participants from Part 2 to gauge their response to the newly revised story. The excitement was markedly different and more enthusiastic.
