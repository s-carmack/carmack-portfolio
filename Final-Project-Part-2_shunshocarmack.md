### Final Project, Part 2

#### Outline/Wireframe
Following my initial research and outline in [Final Project, Part 1](https://s-carmack.github.io/carmack-portfolio/Final-Project-Part-1_shunshocarmack.html) I began creating a wireframe for my project. Much to my dismay, I discovered that the data I had did not support the project I had initially outlined. This threw my entire project for a bit of a loop and I had to start searching for new data or new angles for my data. After searching for a couple of hours, I was able to locate a different facet of the data regarding diversity in U.S. Published Children's Books. The data was from the same organization, [CCBC](https://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/) but it was from a [blog post](http://ccblogc.blogspot.com/2020/06/the-numbers-are-in-2019-ccbc-diversity.html) during the pandemic. After sorting through the data, I found a data point that was not located throughout the rest of their website discussing the representation of disabilities among main characters in children's books. Jumping off of that, I quickly begain to redesign a story, scrapping all of the visualizations I had created up until that point.

I decided to do my wireframe in Shorthand. This decision was primarily made because of the problems I experienced in the past, where I would design something by hand and then not be able to realize my vision of the design in technical tools. Creating a wireframe directly in Shorthand did come with its own challenges. Because I didn't have an initial design in mind, I fumbled around quite a bit trying to determine the best framework for my story. I built one almost completely, which took several hours, and realized it didn't work at all. So, I made a second attempt at the process that was more successful. However, as will be seen by the responses from interviews below, I have many changes that I will need to incorporate.

#### User Research and Interviews

My target audience is anyone who has connections to children or the book publishing world.

As such, for this set of interviews, I selected a mixed demographic of ages and professions:

ID | Identifying Gender | Age Range | Profession
---|---|---|---
Respondant 1 | Female | 65-75 | Retired Teacher and Counselor
Respondant 2 | Male | 25-35 | Communication Studies Graduate Student
Respondant 3 | Male | 65-75 | Retired Statistician
Respondant 4 | Female | 25-35 | Former Youth Librarian and Current Youth Worker

Each of these individuals have a connection to youth, either through young siblings, grandchildren, or profession. As compared to the last time I sought interviews, I made sure to have more age representation. Especially because I have a wide range of targeted audience members, having a broader range of ages was important. Finally, I sought out individuals who have experience with communication and data, hoping to obtain feedback on any concerning areas.

Each person was asked a series of questions:
1. Can you tell me what these visualizations are about?
2. What was confusing, unclear, or missing?
3. What did you want more of?
4. What did you want less of?
5. How did the story make you feel?
6. Any other thoughts and suggestions?


#### Planned Changes
After collecting and collating the feedback in the previous stage, I went back through the entire Shorthand wireframe and decided on a few areas I definitely needed to revise:
1. Making sure all sources, photo credits, and citations are included somewhere in the presentation.
2. Separating out the data about race and presenting it in a new method.
3. Conduct another search to see if additional data is available regarding disabilties in children's literature.
4. Stronger connections to resources for the "Call to Action" section -- and being sure to delineate the "Call to Action" section.
5. Standardize use of fonts throughout. And, consider adding in an additional voice to increase the storytelling aspect.
