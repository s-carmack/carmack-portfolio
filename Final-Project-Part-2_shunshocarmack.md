### Final Project, Part 2

#### Outline/Wireframe
Following my initial research and outline in [Final Project, Part 1](https://s-carmack.github.io/carmack-portfolio/Final-Project-Part-1_shunshocarmack.html) I began creating a wireframe for my project and had constructed the framework for my entire story. At that point, I began to create the graphs for the original story. Much to my dismay, I discovered that the data I had did not support the project I had initially outlined. This threw my entire project for a bit of a loop and I had to start searching for new data or new angles for my data. After searching for a couple of hours, I was able to locate a different facet of the data regarding diversity in U.S. Published Children's Books. The data was from the same organization, [CCBC](https://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/) but it was from a [blog post](http://ccblogc.blogspot.com/2020/06/the-numbers-are-in-2019-ccbc-diversity.html) during the pandemic. After sorting through the data, I found a data point that was not located throughout the rest of their website discussing the representation of disabilities among main characters in children's books. Jumping off of that, I quickly begain to redesign a story, scrapping all of the visualizations I had created up until that point.

I decided to do my wireframe in Shorthand. This decision was primarily made because of the problems I experienced in the past, where I would design something by hand and then not be able to realize my vision of the design in technical tools. Creating a wireframe directly in Shorthand did come with its own challenges. Because I didn't have an initial design in mind, I fumbled around quite a bit trying to determine the best framework for my story. I built one almost completely, which took several hours, and realized it didn't work at all. So, I made a second attempt at the process that was more successful. However, as will be seen by the responses from interviews below, I have many changes that I will need to incorporate.

The second wireframe I built can be seen [here on Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/6soCIw45tC3tUNzi)

#### User Research and Interviews

My target audience is anyone who has connections to children or the book publishing world.

As such, for this set of interviews, I selected a mixed demographic of ages and professions:

ID | Identifying Gender | Age Range | Profession
---|---|---|---
Respondant 1 | Female | 65-75 | Retired Teacher and Counselor
Respondant 2 | Male | 25-35 | Communication Studies Graduate Student
Respondant 3 | Male | 65-75 | Retired Statistician
Respondant 4 | Female | 25-35 | Youth Worker

Each of these individuals have a connection to youth, either through young siblings, grandchildren, or profession. As compared to the last time I sought interviews, I made sure to have more age representation. Especially because I have a wide range of targeted audience members, having a broader range of ages was important. Finally, I sought out individuals who have experience with communication and data, hoping to obtain feedback on any concerning areas.

Each person was asked a series of questions:
1. Can you tell me what these visualizations are about?
2. What was confusing, unclear, or missing?
3. What did you want more of?
4. What did you want less of?
5. How did the story make you feel?
6. Any other thoughts and suggestions?


##### Interview Results
Only Respondants 1, 2, and 4 responded to the interviews.

1. Can you tell me what these visualizations are about?

**Respondant 1:** The large pictures were to make the study attractive and easy to read, which they did. They were a relief from all the data. People graphics were clear, along with numbers and colors. 

**Respondant 2** Children's books.

**Respondant 4:** Diversity in children's books.


2. What was confusing, unclear, or missing?

**Respondant 1:** The sources using initials is really difficult for me. I struggle to retain that information and I constantly have to scroll through the information to remember what it is. People tease me but I need those things spelled out. Also, I think it's interesting that you lumped the "Brown Skin" with "Latinx" -- I think that's a little unfortunate because those groups can be really different. My niece is Asian Indian and she considers herself Brown Skin but she isn't Latinx. I would seperate those. And, on the demographic graphs, what does the "=0.1%" mean? I don't understand that.

**Respondant 2:** I think this is one of those things where the "Vote with your dollar" was compelling but should there be any data or stats with "Why Representation Matters?" section? And, maybe just cite the resources. It needs something to anchor it.

**Respondant 4:** I think the story arc is off -- I would move the demographics around. And, keep the comparisons consistent. I mean, Latinx and Brown Skin aren't necessarily the same. So, don't compare those. And, the story is supposed to be about disabled main characters


3. What did you want more of?

**Respondant 1:** Do you need a definition of "disabled"? I think it'd be nice. Does it include learning disabilties? Physical? I do wish the visualizations were more in line with size and ratio between the different graphs. It does something with size and emphasis when you have the icons be different sizes. I'm not sure that's great. And, I wish they were in order of size. And, I don't know if it's possible, but I wonder what would happen if you had a list of disabilty books or more resources for people to use and even visualize some of them.

**Respondant 2:** Honestly, where data is coming from. Visually it's really engaging but it needs more transparancy. And, maybe something in the story more related to disabled children. I wonder if there's a way to talk about how services and representation is lacking across the board? Maybe it's a part of a larger problem, like lack of funding for schools for disabled children, maybe other issues with media. Something related but not too far afield.

**Respondant 4:** More flow. It just seems a little choppy between sections. Oh, and I noticed that there were a lot of missing sources. Where'd you get the photos from? And where's the data from?


4. What did you want less of?

**Respondant 1:** I don't see anything in excess.

**Respondant 2:** I think if anything, there's that second section, there's a lot of scrolling for that one point. And my fingers get "ew, when am I going to get done scrolling?!" And, in comparison to other important points, it takes up a lot of real estate.

**Respondant 4:** Sometimes it felt like you were just trying to have a variety of styles or templates. Forget that. Just focus on your story and get the data out there. Simple doesn't have to be bad here.


5. How did the story make you feel?

**Respondant 1:** Makes me think about what books throughout history have had with representation, such as Dicken's Tiny Tim. And, I like the part of "Nobody is one thing" -- that's really good. People have more to give than just one talent or just one thing. Because I'd like to write, it makes me desire to solve the problem. Having a daddy that was disabled, it means a lot to me.

**Respondant 2:** It's a compelling story. It makes you get up in arms about the lack of representation for disabled students.

**Respondant 4:** Sad. A little shocked that the ratio is so different as compared to other designations. 


6. Any other thoughts and suggestions?

**Respondant 1:** What is the "1" at the top of the page? Or the "Capela do Senhora Pedro, at Miramar"? These are confusing. Otherwise, it's visually pleasing and attractive. Plenty of white space and font size is good.

**Respondant 2:** I think the pictures are really compelling. They look fantastic. I think too, maybe talk about the lack of understanding of the situation? And, if there isn't data, talk about the lack of data? Ooh, that'd be interesting. And to visualize that.

**Respondant 4:** I'm not sure. There seems something off about the story or something missing but I'm not sure what. Maybe more on types of represented disabilaties? Specific types of children? Any intersection between race and 



#### Planned Changes
After collecting and collating the feedback in the previous stage, I went back through the entire Shorthand wireframe and decided on a few areas I definitely needed to revise:
1. Making sure all sources, photo credits, and citations are included somewhere in the presentation.
2. Separating out the data about race and presenting it in a new method.
3. Conduct another search to see if additional data is available regarding disabilties in children's literature. And if it isn't, talk about it. If possible, add, Particularly to add depth towards the end of the story before the "Call to Action" section.
4. Stronger connections to resources for the "Call to Action" section -- and being sure to delineate the "Call to Action" section.
5. Standardize use of fonts throughout. And, consider adding in an additional voice to increase the storytelling aspect.
