## Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
### Step 1 - Find a Data Visualization


After exploring the internet, I stumbled upon a webpage filled with data visualizations done by [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/) describing [world heritage statistics](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat/#d1) around the globe. For this assignment, I decided to focus on the first set of statistics on the page entitled "Number of World Heritage Properties by region." This heading referred to a set of provided statistics used to create three different visualizations: a column graph, a pie chart, and a table. Based on this set, I was able to use the data found within the table and create an Excel spreadsheet with the information.

##### Visualization 1 - Column Chart

##### Visualization 2 - Pie Chart

##### Visualization 3 - Table

##### Overall observations about the data visualization
Three different visualizations were created from one data set: a column chart, a pie chart, and a table. The table had all the information that was then divided to create the column chart and the pie chart. My initial response was that this set of visualizations did a good job not putting too much information into the two more visual/complicated visualizations, allowing each to focus on a particular theme or concept. Additionally, notes that discussed choices in data handling were included in the table visualization, allowing readers to understand how some data had been categorized. As a set, the three worked together well to help highlight different aspects of the data. However, I noticed a few things on the individual visualizations that did and didn’t work well. The column chart had delineated regions but put abbreviations on them that either I didn’t know or were non-standard, making the chart difficult to comprehend. They could be discovered by going to the third visualization (the table) but that was set apart as a separate chart, making the column chart dependent on exterior information. The types of properties were designated by color, showing the different types of properties within each region and gave an accompanying key, which was great. However, the color selections were not intuitive in their color associations/designations. Additionally, the chart used a combination of red, green, and blue, the first two colors being particularly problematic for some color-blind individuals. Although the colors were separated by blue, it doesn’t mean there wouldn’t be confusion in understanding which part of the column was green or red. Additionally, the y-axis that designate properties quantities used a numbering system that was strange – it operated by doubling the first value and then subtracting 1. Then, the first value was added to the number to get the next tick-value. For the next, it added the first value and subtracted 1 again, beginning the cycle anew. This non-linear numbering system was odd and gave no added meaning to the chart – in fact, it made it more difficult for me to understand the chart. The chart was also difficult in that some regions had such small colored slices; they were unreadable and essential worthless to the reader except to convey that there are very small amounts of those categories in the region. As such, the y-axis also was limited in usefulness to gauge quantities. The chart does employ a hover function, with a popup that discusses the quantities of each property within the region, something that is lost upon download. And within those popups, the text is uniform, meaning that it doesn’t visually distinguish between the total amount and the amount for each region. This takes extra thought for reading and interpreting the data. And it makes the lines behind the columns unnecessary. The pie chart used the region abbreviations from the column chart and divided the segments by color and attached region designators on each segment, albeit in varied methods. When hovering the cursor over a segment, it would detach from the rest of the pie and show a popup that spelled out the region abbreviation and gave the overall number of properties and the region’s percent of the world’s properties. This was better data for understanding the chart, but it posed a few problems (red/green was used again) and it doubled information that was later revealed within the hover. It also didn’t mention that there was a hover function, so initially viewing the chart was difficult for comprehension beyond grasping the approximate size of each region. On a positive note, the segments looked proportional to their percentages. But the text was difficult to read that was overlaid the pie segments. Additionally, when the image was downloaded, the hover action did not download with it, making it lose meaning and context. Finally, the table held all the information, and it was able to show it all with added explanation of data. However, it seemed to be organized in revers alphabetical order, which is contrary to most English speaker’s understanding of organization. Finally, the “Total” line was not immediately distinguishable form the regions, making it take longer to grasp the data and what it meant for the globe.
 
##### Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?
The primary audience is people looking for World Heritage statistics, particularly geared towards adults or interested youth. Additionally, the audience is probably looking for a broad overview of heritage data and where it is around the globe. I think it’s effective for two different types of people: those who just wanted a basic impression about size or quantity but aren’t actually interested in the exact numbers or scale; and, the other type is someone who is willing to really explore the charts, hovering over every column or segment and really reading carefully. However, it mostly is ineffective because it doesn’t show the information in a clean way with enough context, which makes the two colorful charts less powerful and less meaningful. Additionally, because the organization of the data in the table is not immediately decipherable, it’s difficult to engage with all the information the table is presenting. It’s there for the diligent audience but no one else will take the time to engage with it. 

##### Final thoughts and recommendations:
Overall, I found this method of evaluation faster to use but I was less comfortable with the degree of subjectiveness I had to use. The other evaluation process we used felt more objective and required stating concrete changes without just discussing the positives and negatives. However, the last evaluation method’s use of the graph to place it on a range of effectiveness was also disconcerting. I think overall this evaluation method was strong but could benefit from adding a measurement for Type of Visualization, removing it from the “Perceptibility” measurement, with a 1 being ineffective/diminishing data and 10 being effective/showcases data, and assessing how the type of visualization used was either an asset or detriment to the data. I would also add a measurement for Accessibility, using 1 for Inaccessible and 10 for Highly Accessible, using this to gauge the ability for many device types (mobile, tablet, desktop) or ability types (colorblind, blind, etc.) to make use of the chart.

### Step 3 - Wireframe a Solution
For this step of the process, I initially began with paper and markers but found I was struggling to make the process work well. So, I switched gears and began designing wireframes in Canva. This moved must faster and I was able to work with the information quickly. Although Canva does have an option to upload Excel spreadsheets for creating charts or graphs, I didn't do that this time. I manually worked with the data to get it to look how I wanted. In the next stage, I will be able to comment on what I found positive and negative about that process.

With Canva, I created wireframes for three different charts to mirror the three that were provided by UNESCO. I took each visualization individually while trying to be aware of its connection to my other two visualizations.

At the tope of the redesigned visualizations, I had an overall header for the set with a subtitle and then the three visualizations followed. The entire piece that I sent to my respondants can be found as a pdf here:
