## Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
### Step 1 - Find a Data Visualization


After exploring the internet, I stumbled upon a webpage filled with data visualizations done by [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/) describing [world heritage statistics](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat/#d1) around the globe. For this assignment, I decided to focus on the first set of statistics on the page entitled "Number of World Heritage Properties by region." This heading referred to a set of provided statistics used to create three different visualizations: a column graph, a pie chart, and a table.
