## Final Project, Part 1

### Outline
##### High-level Project Summary
Diversity in U.S. Children's Books is Not Reflective of the Nation's Population.

##### Project Structure
**Set-Up:** Current state of diversity in Children's Books published in the United States

**Conflict:** The breakdown of representation in Children's Books published in the United States do not reflect the population demographics of the nation

**Conflict, Zoom Out:** U.S. Population demographics Now and Projected Minority-Majority of the Future

**Conflict, Zoom Out:** Improving Children's Books representation between years

**Conflict, Zoom In:** Improvement rate between representation doesn't match the rate in population shift

**Conflict, Zoom In:** How often or what percentage of challenged and banned Children's Books are diverse.

**Problem:** This matters because the understanding of diversity is shown to impact the comfort people have with others and increases acceptance, decreases bigotry, etc.

**Resolution:** Increasing diverse representation with Children's Books involves the publishers, the providers, and the readers voting with their dollars, reading more diverse books, and highlighting more diverse books.

### Data Sources
##### Data Sources
[CCBC Diversity Statistics](https://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/literature-resources/ccbc-diversity-statistics/)
This resources has years of data recording the diversity of published children's books. Additionally, it differentiates on U.S. Publishers vs. International sources, and has changed categories to be more inclusive. This makes it somewhat unweildy because categories are changing but the organization has documented those changes carefully. I plan to use this to discuss the varying status of representation of diversity in Children's Books through history and use it to connect to how it matches other issues in the U.S.

[United States Census Bureau Quick Facts, U.S. Population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/POP010220)
This site provides the most recent data for the U.S. Population demographics. I plan to use this to discuss the current status of the U.S. population.

[World Population Review, United States Population](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/united-states-population)
This resource looks at the U.S. population statistics and provides additional links to other sources of gauging the U.S. population. I plan on using this source to flesh out more of my U.S. population visualizations and connect to additional resources as needed.

[Demographic Turning Points for the United States: Population Projections for 2020 to 2060](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.html)
This resource looks at the projected changes in U.S. population over the next ~40 years. I'm planning on using this data to argue for why diverse books are going to be more important moving forward and how the current rate of change is not being matched by the publishing world.

[Frequently Challenged Books](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks)
This site hosts many data sets that discuss the types of books being challenged and banned throughout the U.S. Specifically, I'm wanting to use this resource to show why it's difficult for diversity in Children's books to exist and how difficult it is for them to be on shelves.

### Method and Medium
The basic approach for this project includes a methodical process. I intend to dive deeper into the data and see exactly what I have to work with. If I need any additional data, I intend to do a brief search and then use whatever I have to construct the final narrative. I will outline each stopping point of the story and decide what kind of visualization I will need for each piece and whether or not I want an image to accompany it. This will primarily be accomplished using rough sketches. Then, I will take each outlined section and translate it into a digital tool. As of now, I think I'll need to use a combination of Flourish and Canva to create the full effect of what I want to show with my final presentation. Any images I use I am planning on objtaining either through personal files or on Unsplash.

Following the creation of each section, I'm planning on using Shorthand to host my entire final presentation. Instead of compiling everything at the end, I'm going to try to add each section as it is ready so that I can follow the flow of the page and make any adjustments as needed.
