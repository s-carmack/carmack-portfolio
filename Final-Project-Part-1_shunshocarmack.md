## Final Project, Part 1

### Outline
##### High-level Project Summary
Diversity in U.S. Children's Books is Not Reflective of the Nation's Population.

##### Project Structure
Set-Up: Current state of diversity in Children's Books published in the United States
Conflict: The breakdown of representation in Children's Books published in the United States do not reflect the population demographics of the nation
Conflict, Zoom Out: U.S. Population demographics Now and Projected Minority-Majority of the Future
Conflict, Zoom Out: Improving Children's Books representation between years
Conflict, Zoom In: Improvement rate between representation doesn't match the rate in population shift
Problem: This matters because the understanding of diversity is shown to impact the comfort people have with others and increases acceptance, decreases bigotry, etc.
Resolution: Increasing diverse representation with Children's Books involves the publishers, the providers, and the readers
